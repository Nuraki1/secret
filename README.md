       Node.js 
       ------

     -  Node is a javascript runtime that enables to run the js outside the browser
               X it's not programming language
               X it's not framework

       javascript runtime :

         An Entire Environment and infrastructure required to execute your JavaScript code  such as:-
              - The JavaScript engine (V8 engine)
              - runtime modules,     
              - libraries
              
           NB. Node.js provides a rich set of RUNTIME MODULES that extend the capabilities of JavaScript
               beyond what is available in the browser environment.   

                   - fs (File System): tools to read, write, or manipulate files
                   - http and https:   tools for building and interacting with web servers
                   - path
                   - util
                   - events
                   - crypto
                   - stream
                   - os
